# dita-plant-uml
DITA Open Toolkit plugin which allows publishing embedded Plant UML diagrams to HTML and PDF.

http://plantuml.com/index

The plugin was tested and developed with DITA OT 3.2.1.

If you set the @outputclass="embed-plant-uml" attribute on a DITA <foreign> element the plugin will attempt to convert it to SVG.
The "samples" folder contains a sample DITA topic with a Plant UML equation which is properly displayed when converted to HTML and PDF-based outputs.
